## Get Started
- Since tweet raw data is confidential, we cannot add them to this repo. However, you can acquire raw data by filling in customer/access tokens/secrets in ./dataset/text_script.py then run 
```
python text_script.py MFTC_V4.json <desired_output_file_name>
```
You can acquire customer/access tokens/secrets from [here](https://themepacific.com/how-to-generate-api-key-consumer-token-access-key-for-twitter-oauth/994/)
